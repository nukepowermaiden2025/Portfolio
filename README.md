# About Me
<p >  Being born and raised in the heart of it all, the great state of Ohio, many might expect that 
    I am a die hard OSU fan and the assumption is correct. Frankly, I only care about football when I
    am amongst my fellow buckeyes. I suspect that there are others out there. We bleed scarlet and gray
    from dawn to the dying of the light. We are the ultimate spectators. No need for loudness. No need
    for ruidness. We simply exist, we live life, we watch football, we get excited on occasion.
    No chaos required.

<p>     Enter, Kourtney, aspiring Web Developer stage left. Yes, I know I have just refered to my self in
    the third person. I think of myself always in a self imposed beta development. It is so exciting learn to new technologies.
    My method of solving problems is to visualize 
    the solution as a bag of cats waiting to be released. Wierd analogy, right? We have to release
    the cats and let all the chaos out, before the underlying issue can be solved. You could
    say that I am comfortable with a certain level of it. I have found that once all the questions have
    had their day in the sun, the solution is obvious. In short, my name is Kourtney, I like to find
    solutions in the chaos, while contributing to it as little as possible. I am usually successful at both.
